  MANDATORY: Apply Barbara Minto's MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) principle:

  1. MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE: Each section/subsection must be distinct with NO overlap.
     - Wrong: "Hardware" and "Electronics" (electronics is part of hardware)
     - Correct: "Hardware", "Software", "Operations" (distinct categories)

  2. COLLECTIVELY EXHAUSTIVE: Together, all sections must cover the ENTIRE topic.
     - Ensure no important aspect is missing
     - The 3 sections at each level must provide complete coverage

  3. LOGICAL GROUPING: Group similar concepts under the same parent node.
     - Each parent should have children of the same type/abstraction level

structure_requirements:
  mandatory_structure: "1*3*3*3"
  total_nodes: 40
  levels:
    - level: 1
      prefix: "#"
      content: "Topic title (root node)"
      count: "EXACTLY 1"
    - level: 2
      prefix: "##"
      content: "Main sections (numbered: 1., 2., 3.)"
      count: "EXACTLY 3 sections"
    - level: 3
      prefix: "###"
      content: "Subsections (numbered: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3)"
      count: "EXACTLY 3 per section (9 total)"
    - level: 4
      prefix: "####"
      content: "Detail nodes (not numbered)"
      count: "EXACTLY 3 per subsection (27 total)"

line_format: |
  Each line must follow this exact format:
  [[PREFIX]] [[NUMBER]] [[LABEL]]; [[WEB_SEARCH_QUERY]]
  
  Where:
  - [[PREFIX]]: Heading indicator (#, ##, ###, ####)
  - [[NUMBER]]: Section number (only for ## and ###)
  - [[LABEL]]: Short label (1-3 words) displayed on map node
  - [[WEB_SEARCH_QUERY]]: Search string for Google (4-6 keywords)

search_query_rules:
  title_node:
    format: "keyword_list"
    max_keywords: 4
    example: "telecommunications satellite technology systems"
  
  section_node:
    format: "topic + section keywords"
    max_keywords: 5
    example: "{topic} payload transponder design"
  
  subsection_node:
    format: "topic + section + subsection keywords"
    max_keywords: 6
    example: "{topic} payload antenna beam coverage"
  
  detail_node:
    format: "specific technical search"
    max_keywords: 6
    example: "{topic} antenna phased array technology"

output_constraints:
  - NO blank lines between entries
  - NO explanations or comments
  - ONLY the outline content
  - Labels must be concise (1-3 words)
  - Search queries must be effective for web research
  - Maintain logical hierarchy and flow
