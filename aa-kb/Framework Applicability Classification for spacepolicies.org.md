## TIER 2: Adapted Analysis Frameworks
**Definition**: Core analysis executable with OSINT, but requires methodological simplification or expert interpretation; some components inaccessible (classified) but partial execution still informative.

**Recommended allocation**: 25-30% of blog content

### Frameworks (6 total):

**1.2 Classical Geopolitical Theories**
- **Rationale**: Mackinder/Mahan/Spykman applicable to space geography, but requires deep expertise in geopolitics + orbital mechanics
- **Adaptation**: Focus on historical analogs (19th century naval strategy → cislunar positioning)
- **Output**: Conceptual mapping of strategic "terrain" with delta-v contours
- **Article format**: "Mackinder's Heartland in Orbit: Geostationary Control as Strategic Pivot"

**2.2 Hard, Soft, & Smart Power**
- **Rationale**: Power assessment possible via public capabilities, diplomatic outcomes, media analysis—but "ground truth" effectiveness requires inside knowledge
- **Adaptation**: Focus on observable manifestations (treaty leadership, scientific prestige) rather than classified military capabilities
- **Output**: Power typology with case examples
- **Article format**: "ESA's Soft Power Strategy: Norm-Setting vs. Capability-Building"

**3.1 Alliance Relationship Analysis**
- **Rationale**: Treaty texts and public statements accessible; operational integration and trust metrics require insider access
- **Adaptation**: Analyze formal structures (MOUs, technical annexes) + infer from budget allocations
- **Output**: Alliance health scorecard (Strategic Alignment, Burden-Sharing visible; Trust/Reliability inferred)
- **Article format**: "Artemis Accords Five-Year Health Check: Treaty vs. Reality"

**3.3 Levels of Analysis (Waltz)**
- **Rationale**: Framework fully applicable, but causal weighting requires deep historical knowledge + counterfactual reasoning
- **Adaptation**: Apply retrospectively to completed events (Space Force creation, Chinese lunar program acceleration)
- **Output**: Multi-level causal explanation with percentage weighting
- **Article format**: "Why Did [X Happen]? Individual, State, and Systemic Drivers"

**5.5 Cross-Impact Analysis**
- **Rationale**: Probabilistic method requiring expert judgment on event interactions—simplified version (qualitative) feasible
- **Adaptation**: Focus on directional relationships (Event A increases/decreases likelihood of Event B) rather than precise probabilities
- **Output**: Cross-impact matrix with interaction arrows
- **Article format**: "How Fusion Breakthrough Would Cascade Through Space Propulsion Roadmaps"

**6.2 Morphological Analysis**
- **Rationale**: Design space exploration possible, but exhaustive analysis (all combinations) computationally intensive
- **Adaptation**: Select 3-4 critical dimensions, analyze subset of configurations
- **Output**: Morphological box with feasible solutions highlighted
- **Article format**: "Configuration Space for [Lunar Base Architecture/Debris Removal Systems]"

---

## TIER 3: Case Study Illustration Only
**Definition**: Too complex or resource-intensive for original execution in blog format; value lies in explaining methodology + analyzing well-documented historical cases.

**Recommended allocation**: 10-15% of blog content (educational/pedagogical focus)

### Frameworks (5 total):

**1.3 Causal Layered Analysis**
- **Rationale**: Requires deep discourse analysis (speeches, documents, mythic interpretation) beyond typical blog research depth
- **Limitation**: Myth/Metaphor layer demands cultural anthropology expertise
- **Blog Approach**: Explain 4-layer framework + analyze published CLA (e.g., Inayatullah's own space futures work)
- **Article format**: "Understanding CLA: Deconstructing the 'Mars as Backup Planet' Narrative"

**2.1 Instruments of National Power (DIME)**
- **Rationale**: Whole-of-government view requires access to classified military/intelligence integration—visible only retrospectively
- **Limitation**: Real-time DIME coordination is classified; can only analyze historical cases post-declassification
- **Blog Approach**: Explain framework + dissect historical case (e.g., Cold War space race DIME integration)
- **Article format**: "DIME in Action: How the Apollo Program Synchronized All Instruments"

**4.2 Red Team Blue Team Analysis**
- **Rationale**: Actual exercises are classified; simulating realistic attacks requires technical/operational expertise beyond blog scope
- **Limitation**: Cannot conduct genuine Red Team exercise; results would be speculative
- **Blog Approach**: Explain methodology + analyze declassified exercises (Schriever Wargame unclass briefings)
- **Article format**: "Inside Red Team Exercises: Lessons from [Declassified Case]"

**4.3 War-gaming**
- **Rationale**: Multi-day games with SME panels, technical adjudication, classified scenarios—impossible to replicate
- **Limitation**: Realistic games require resources (participants, models, time) beyond individual capacity
- **Blog Approach**: Explain game architecture + analyze published war-game results (CSIS reports, RAND studies)
- **Article format**: "Anatomy of a Space Wargame: Dissecting the 2022 Cislunar Crisis Simulation"

**5.2 Delphi Method**
- **Rationale**: Requires assembling expert panel + conducting multi-round surveys—logistically unfeasible for blog
- **Limitation**: Credible Delphi needs 15-30 diverse experts; response rates typically 40-60% per round
- **Blog Approach**: Explain methodology + analyze published Delphi studies (OECD space foresight, ESA technology roadmaps)
- **Article format**: "Delphi Forecasting in Space: Review of [Published Study]"

---

## TIER 4: Consultation-Exclusive Methods
**Definition**: Impossible to execute meaningfully without privileged access (classified briefings, institutional authority, insider networks); mention possible but application infeasible for public blog.

**Recommended allocation**: 0-5% (only as "what professional analysts use" context)

### Frameworks (3 total):

**2.4 Security Sector Analysis**
- **Rationale**: Requires institutional access—interviews with agency leadership, classified budget data, acquisition program details
- **Limitation**: Public org charts + budget toplines insufficient for rigorous SSA
- **Blog Mention Only**: "Professional defense analysts use SSA to audit space governance—requires classified access"
- **Possible Exception**: Historical SSA of defunct programs (Soviet space program post-declassification)

**Note**: Only 3 frameworks fall into Tier 4 because most others, while challenging, remain partially executable with OSINT + expert interpretation. Security Sector Analysis is the clearest "locked behind clearance" framework. Delphi Method is Tier 3 (not 4) because you can *illustrate* it via published studies, even if you can't execute it.

## Strategic Content Mix Recommendation

**Baseline Distribution (Year 1)**:
- **65% Tier 1** (Blog-Native): 2-3 articles/month—these drive consistent traffic
- **25% Tier 2** (Adapted): 1 article/month—these establish analytical depth
- **10% Tier 3** (Illustrative): 1 article/quarter—these demonstrate methodological sophistication

**Tier 4**: Reference in "About Our Methodology" page, but don't attempt articles

**Quality vs. Quantity Trade-off**:
- Tier 1 articles: 2000-3000 words, 2-week research cycle
- Tier 2 articles: 3500-5000 words, 3-4 week research cycle (deeper analysis)
- Tier 3 articles: 2500-3500 words, 1-2 week cycle (less original research, more synthesis)

This distribution ensures regular cadence (3-4 posts/month) while maintaining analytical rigor and audience engagement.
