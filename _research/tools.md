# STRATEGIC ANALYSIS METHODOLOGIES

A comprehensive toolkit of analytical methodologies for evaluating geopolitical, defense, security, and strategic positioning of entities (states, organizations, programs).

---

## 1. Strategic Analysis & Context

Methodologies for understanding the broad operating environment and positioning.

## 2. Geopolitical & Power Assessment

Methodologies for analyzing state behavior, power dynamics, and strategic positioning.

### 2.1 Classical Geopolitical Theories

**Mackinder's Heartland Theory:**
Control of the Eurasian "Heartland" (Central Asia) as key to world dominance. "Who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island."

**Mahan's Sea Power Theory:**
Naval supremacy and control of sea lanes as foundation of national power. Emphasis on maritime chokepoints and trade routes.

**Spykman's Rimland Theory:**
Control of the coastal "Rimland" (peripheral areas around Eurasia) as more strategically significant than the Heartland.

**Levels of Analysis (Waltz):**
- **Individual level:** Leader psychology, decision-making
- **State level:** Domestic politics, regime type, institutional structure
- **System level:** International power distribution, anarchy, alliances

**Application:** Geographic constraints analysis, strategic positioning, long-term structural factors.

---

- **E**conomic: Trade, sanctions, aid, financial instruments

**Extended Frameworks:** MIDLIFE (Military, Informational, Diplomatic, Law enforcement, Intelligence, Financial, Economic), PMESII-PT

**Hard/Soft/Smart Power (Nye):**
- **Hard Power:** Coercion through military force or economic pressure

- **Smart Power:** Strategic combination of hard and soft power

**Application:** Capability assessment, influence mechanism analysis, balance of power evaluation.

Fundamental reasoning methodology:
1. **Identify assumptions:** List all beliefs about the problem
2. **Break down to fundamentals:** Reduce to basic, undeniable truths
3. **Rebuild from foundation:** Construct new understanding from basics
4. **Challenge orthodoxy:** Question "how things have always been done"

**Application:** Disruptive innovation, challenging conventional wisdom, fundamental feasibility assessment.

---

## 4. Foresight & Futures

Methodologies for exploring future possibilities and long-term planning.

### 4.1 Scenario Planning

Structured future exploration:
- **Identify driving forces:** Key factors shaping the future
- **Determine critical uncertainties:** High-impact, high-uncertainty factors

**Application:** Long-term planning, strategic hedging, contingency preparation.

---

### 4.2 Horizon Analysis

**Three Horizons Framework:**
- **H1 (Horizon 1):** Maintaining and defending current core business/capabilities
- **H2 (Horizon 2):** Developing emerging opportunities, scaling innovations
- **H3 (Horizon 3):** Exploring radical innovation, future options, experiments

**Futures Wheel:**
Radial impact mapping from central event/trend → direct consequences → indirect consequences → tertiary effects

**Cross-Impact Analysis:**
Matrix examination of how trends/events influence each other's probability and impact, revealing interdependencies and feedback loops

**Weak Signals Detection:**
Early indicators of emerging changes, often dismissed or overlooked

**Application:** Strategic foresight, innovation portfolio balance, ripple effect analysis.

---

### 4.3 Causal Layered Analysis (CLA)

Deep structural analysis across four layers:
1. **Litany:** Surface level, visible events, "what happened"
2. **Systems:** Underlying structures, institutions, policies causing litany
3. **Worldview:** Cultural assumptions, paradigms, mental models
4. **Myth/Metaphor:** Deep narratives, unconscious beliefs, archetypes
