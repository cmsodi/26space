# AfSA & ALCE: The Regional Shield Against Orbital Hegemony

Regional space coalitions AfSA and ALCE represent a strategic counter to US-China orbital duopoly, creating alternative governance pathways for Global South space capabilities. These emerging entities challenge the established order by aggregating regional capabilities and negotiating power, fundamentally altering the dynamics of global space governance.

## Introduction

The contemporary space domain is characterized by an increasingly pronounced [US-China orbital duopoly](https://doi.org/10.1093/isagsq/ksad067) that dominates both technological capabilities and governance structures. This bipolar arrangement has created limited opportunities for Global South participation in space activities, with most developing nations relegated to passive consumers of space services or junior partners in asymmetric bilateral agreements. The [existing governance frameworks](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsse.2025.11.001), primarily based on the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and subsequent agreements, were designed for a different era and prove inadequate for addressing the needs and aspirations of regional coalitions seeking autonomous space capabilities.

Traditional space cooperation has followed predictable patterns of bilateral technology transfer, where established space powers selectively share capabilities with developing nations under restrictive conditions. This model reinforces dependency relationships and limits the ability of emerging space nations to develop indigenous capabilities or pursue independent space strategies.

The emergence of regional space entities like the African Space Agency (AfSA) and the Latin American and Caribbean Space Agency (ALCE) represents a fundamental challenge to these established orbital power structures. Global South nations are increasingly seeking autonomous space capabilities that operate outside the constraining frameworks imposed by superpower competition. This shift reflects broader technology sovereignty demands that conflict with existing dependency relationships, as nations recognize space capabilities as critical infrastructure for development and security.

## Governance Architecture Evolution

### Regional Coalition Models

The development of regional space coalitions has spawned diverse [governance models](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsse.2025.11.001) that reflect different approaches to balancing sovereignty with cooperation. These models range from sovereign blocs that maintain strong national control, to technology hubs that prioritize capability sharing, diplomatic coalitions focused on policy coordination, and hybrid networks that combine elements of each approach. The African Space Agency is pursuing a continental integration model that seeks to harmonize national space programs under a unified framework, while ALCE emphasizes more flexible partnership structures that accommodate the diverse political and economic contexts of Latin American nations.

Regional integration approaches vary significantly based on existing technological capabilities and geopolitical positioning. Nations with more advanced space programs tend to favor looser coordination mechanisms that preserve their competitive advantages, while those with nascent capabilities support deeper integration to accelerate development through resource pooling and knowledge sharing.

### Autonomy vs Integration Trade-offs

The tension between autonomy and integration presents fundamental challenges for regional coalitions. Higher [autonomy-integration trade-offs](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsse.2025.11.001) configurations reduce external dependency but simultaneously limit access to advanced technologies that remain concentrated in traditional space powers. This creates a strategic dilemma where coalitions must balance their desire for technological sovereignty against the practical need for international cooperation to access critical capabilities.

Hybrid governance models have emerged as a pragmatic response to this challenge, attempting to balance sovereignty demands with international cooperation requirements. These models allow selective engagement with traditional space powers while maintaining regional decision-making autonomy and developing indigenous capabilities. Regional coalitions must carefully navigate between independence aspirations and practical technology needs, creating governance structures flexible enough to adapt to changing geopolitical and technological landscapes.

### Institutional Framework Development

The emergence of regional space entities necessitates the development of new legal and regulatory frameworks that extend beyond existing international treaties. Current space law was crafted primarily by and for traditional space powers, leaving significant gaps in addressing the unique needs and circumstances of regional coalitions. These new frameworks must address issues such as technology sharing within coalitions, collective liability for joint missions, and dispute resolution mechanisms that respect regional sovereignty while ensuring international compliance.

Coordination mechanisms between AfSA and ALCE are creating important precedents for inter-regional space cooperation outside the traditional power structures. These South-South cooperation frameworks demonstrate alternative models for space governance that prioritize horizontal relationships over vertical dependencies. Regional governance structures must accommodate the diverse capabilities and priorities of member states, from nations with established space programs to those just beginning their space journey, creating inclusive frameworks that benefit all participants while advancing collective capabilities.

## Strategic Power Dynamics

### Traditional Power Realignment

The emergence of coordinated regional blocs fundamentally alters the [structural power dynamics](https://doi.org/10.1093/isagsq/ksad067) that have long characterized the space domain. Traditional space powers now face challenges not from individual nations seeking to join the space club, but from organized coalitions that aggregate capabilities and negotiating power. This shift from bilateral to multilateral engagement changes the calculus of space diplomacy and technology transfer.

The US-China orbital duopoly confronts organized Global South alternative governance pathways that operate outside their spheres of influence. Regional coalitions aggregate bargaining power through coordinated negotiations, presenting unified positions in international forums and demanding more equitable terms for technology access and cooperation. This collective approach strengthens the negotiating position of individual nations while creating new centers of space capability development. The [South-South cooperation frameworks](https://doi.org/10.1080/01436597.2015.1108161) emerging from these coalitions represent a fundamental challenge to the established order, demonstrating that space development can proceed through alternative pathways that prioritize regional needs over superpower interests.

### Emerging Technology Bridges

India has positioned itself as a critical technology enabler, leveraging its advanced space capabilities and Global South identity to bridge regional coalitions with cutting-edge technologies. [India's space diplomacy trajectory](https://doi.org/10.29121/shodhkosh.v4.i2.2023.4490) reflects a strategic approach to South-South cooperation, offering cost-effective launch services, satellite technology, and capacity-building programs that provide alternatives to traditional suppliers. This positioning allows India to expand its influence while supporting the autonomy aspirations of regional coalitions.

Technology sharing within coalitions creates new patterns of capability development that reduce individual nation dependencies on traditional suppliers. Horizontal technology transfer between regional coalition members establishes alternative supply chains and knowledge networks that operate independently of traditional power structures. These emerging patterns demonstrate that technological advancement can occur through South-South cooperation, challenging the assumption that space technology must flow from established powers to developing nations.

### Strategic Alliance Choices

The evolving space landscape forces traditional actors to reconsider their strategic alignments. The [EU strategic priorities](https://www.parlament.gv.at/dokument/XXVIII/EU/28161/imfname_11496795.pdf) increasingly recognize the importance of engaging with emerging space actors, creating a strategic dilemma between maintaining Atlantic alliance loyalty and pursuing Global South partnership opportunities. This choice reflects broader geopolitical shifts as the EU seeks to maintain relevance in a multipolar space environment.

Collective procurement and joint missions enhance regional coalition leverage in international forums, demonstrating that coordinated action can achieve outcomes previously available only to major space powers. These initiatives challenge traditional bilateral relationships by offering multilateral alternatives that distribute benefits more equitably among participants. The success of regional frameworks in achieving concrete results strengthens their attractiveness as alternatives to traditional cooperation models.

## Implementation Pathways

### Coalition Leverage Mechanisms

Regional coalitions have developed sophisticated strategies to maximize their collective bargaining power with established space powers. By coordinating negotiation positions and presenting unified demands, these coalitions transform what would be asymmetric bilateral negotiations into more balanced multilateral engagements. This approach has proven particularly effective in securing more favorable terms for technology transfer and capacity-building support.

Joint procurement initiatives demonstrate the practical benefits of coalition approaches. The collective procurement benefits include reduced costs through bulk purchasing, increased negotiating leverage with suppliers, and the ability to demand technology transfer as part of procurement agreements. These initiatives also create opportunities for knowledge sharing among coalition members, as nations with more advanced procurement experience guide those new to space technology acquisition. Shared mission architectures further demonstrate regional capability development outside superpower frameworks, showing that complex space missions can be accomplished through South-South cooperation.

### Technology Sovereignty Development

Regional coalitions prioritize indigenous capability development as a cornerstone of their [technology sovereignty strategies](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsse.2025.11.001). This focus on building local expertise and manufacturing capabilities reflects a long-term vision that extends beyond immediate mission needs to establish sustainable space programs. Technology transfer agreements within coalitions create alternative supply chains that reduce dependence on traditional suppliers while building regional industrial capacity.

Capacity building programs within coalitions take various forms, from joint training initiatives to shared research and development projects. These programs strengthen regional technological autonomy by creating pools of expertise that can support multiple national programs. The emphasis on developing indigenous capabilities extends beyond hardware to include software development, mission planning, and space applications that address regional priorities.

### International Integration Strategies

Regional coalitions pursue selective engagement strategies with traditional space powers, carefully balancing autonomy preservation with the need to access advanced technologies. This selective approach allows coalitions to benefit from international cooperation while avoiding dependency relationships that could compromise their strategic objectives. Multilateral partnerships are structured to ensure that regional sovereignty is maintained while creating pathways for technology access and knowledge transfer.

Global governance participation increasingly occurs through regional bloc representation rather than individual nation engagement. This shift amplifies the voice of smaller space nations while creating more efficient negotiation processes. Regional coalitions coordinate their positions in international forums, presenting unified stances on critical issues such as space debris mitigation, frequency allocation, and the exploitation of space resources.

## Next Steps and Recommendations

The emergence of AfSA and ALCE as significant players in the global space arena requires continuous monitoring and strategic assessment. Key areas for ongoing analysis include tracking the governance model selection processes within these organizations as they evolve from concept to operational reality. The specific choices made regarding centralization, resource allocation, and decision-making structures will significantly impact their effectiveness and longevity.

India's strategic positioning as a technology bridge between regions warrants particular attention. As India expands its space diplomacy initiatives, understanding how it balances commercial interests with South-South solidarity will provide insights into the sustainability of alternative cooperation models. Similarly, evaluating EU strategic alignment decisions regarding Global South space partnerships will reveal whether traditional space powers can adapt to the changing landscape or will attempt to maintain existing hierarchies.

The effectiveness of regional coalition bargaining power in international forums serves as a critical metric for assessing the viability of these alternative governance models. Success in securing favorable terms for technology access, achieving recognition in global governance structures, and implementing joint missions will determine whether regional coalitions represent a temporary phenomenon or a permanent shift in space governance architecture. As these coalitions mature, their ability to deliver tangible benefits to member states while maintaining cohesion in the face of external pressures will ultimately determine their role in shaping the future of human space activities.
