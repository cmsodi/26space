# Stakeholder Mapping: AfSA & ALCE: The Regional Shield Against Orbital Hegemony

## Executive Summary
Analysis identified 28 relevant stakeholders across African and Latin American institutions, major space powers, emerging space nations, and international bodies. The landscape reveals two emerging regional coalitions (AfSA and ALCE) challenging US-China orbital duopoly, with India positioned as a critical technology enabler. The EU faces strategic choices between traditional Atlantic alignment and Global South partnerships.

### Swing Actors
| Actor | Current Position | Could Swing If... | Strategic Value |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| EU/ESA | Neutral | Strategic autonomy priorities override Atlantic ties | High |
| China | Neutral/Opposed | Regional blocs accept BRI space cooperation | High |
| Commercial Operators | Neutral | Regulatory clarity and market access assured | Medium |

## Engagement Strategy Implications

## Key Findings
1. **Bipolar Challenge:** AfSA and ALCE represent the first serious institutional challenge to US-China orbital duopoly, leveraging [South-South cooperation frameworks](https://doi.org/10.1080/01436597.2015.1108161) for space sovereignty
2. **India as Kingmaker:** India's role as cost-effective technology provider is critical for regional coalition viability, offering alternative to traditional space power dependence
3. **EU Strategic Choice:** European position as swing actor could legitimize regional coalitions or reinforce Atlantic space order, with implications for global space governance

## Strategic Implications
The emergence of AfSA and ALCE represents a fundamental shift from bilateral space cooperation to regional bloc formation, challenging the traditional hub-and-spoke model of space governance. Success depends on overcoming resource constraints through collective action and securing alternative technology providers like India. The US-China competition creates opportunities for these regional blocs to leverage great power rivalry for technological access and political space.

## Limitations
Stakeholder positions may shift rapidly as regional institutions mature and great power competition intensifies. Limited visibility into internal coalition dynamics within AfSA and ALCE. Commercial stakeholder positions highly dependent on evolving regulatory frameworks and market access conditions.
