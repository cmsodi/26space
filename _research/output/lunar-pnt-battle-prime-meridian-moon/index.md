# Lunar PNT: The Battle for the Prime Meridian of the Moon

## Hypothesis

The United States is leveraging first-mover advantage through the [Artemis Accords framework](https://doi.org/10.29202/asl/15/5) to establish de facto lunar positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) standards that will become irreversible once lunar infrastructure scales. This strategic maneuver aims to create long-term control over lunar economic activity by establishing technical standards that future actors will have no choice but to adopt. Much like the historical battle over Earth's prime meridian, whoever controls lunar PNT standards will shape the fundamental infrastructure of humanity's expansion beyond Earth.

## Why This Matters

Lunar PNT standards will determine which nations can coordinate precision landings, synchronize resource extraction operations, and charge access fees for timing services. As lunar activities transition from exploration to exploitation, these positioning and timing systems become the fundamental infrastructure layer for [lunar economic control](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389206863_Geopolitical_Dynamics_of_Space_Resource_Exploitation_The_Case_of_Lunar_Mining). The nation or coalition that establishes these standards controls both the physical infrastructure (satellites, ground stations, reference beacons) and the service layer that enables high-value activities from habitat construction to propellant production.

Technical standards have emerged as powerful geopolitical weapons in the space domain, as the [geopolitical competition in space](https://trendsresearch.org/insight/orbital-rivalry-the-u-s-china-competition-and-the-future-of-the-global-space-economy/) increasingly plays out through seemingly neutral technical decisions. The fragmented nature of current space law creates opportunities for first-movers to establish de facto standards through operational precedent rather than formal treaty negotiations. This represents a critical infrastructure battleground where geopolitical competition, technological standards-setting, and economic opportunity converge in ways that will shape humanity's future in space for decades to come.

## Supporting Evidence

### Evidence 1: US Policy Leadership and Coalition Building

The United States has moved decisively to establish lunar PNT leadership through coordinated policy initiatives. The [Presidential directive on lunar time](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Celestial-Time-Standardization-Policy.pdf) issued in April 2024 mandates the development of lunar time standardization, marking the first national-level commitment to addressing this technical challenge. This directive was followed by the comprehensive [Lunar Reference System Policy](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Lunar-Reference-System-Policy.pdf), which establishes the technical framework for US lunar PNT capabilities.

More significantly, the Artemis Accords have created a [29+ nation coalition](https://doi.org/10.29202/asl/15/5) aligned with US standards and approaches to lunar activities. This coalition-building strategy ensures that US technical standards will be implemented across a significant portion of early lunar infrastructure. By embedding PNT standards within the broader Artemis framework, the US has created powerful network effects that make alternative standards increasingly costly to implement.

### Evidence 2: Technical Standards as Control Mechanisms

Technical standards organizations have emerged as [standards battlegrounds](https://ccsds.org/meetings/previousevents/2024spring/lunarforum/) where geopolitical competition plays out through ostensibly neutral technical decisions. The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) and other standards bodies now host intense negotiations over lunar PNT specifications, with national delegations pursuing technical choices that advance their strategic interests. These forums demonstrate how geopolitical competition increasingly manifests through technical standardization rather than traditional diplomatic channels.

#### Technical Foundations of Lunar PNT Control

The physics of lunar timekeeping creates the first layer of control. Due to General Relativity effects, clocks on the lunar surface run approximately 56 microseconds faster per day than on Earth, necessitating a dedicated lunar time standard. This seemingly minor difference compounds rapidly for precision navigation and becomes critical for coordinating autonomous operations, docking maneuvers, and resource extraction timing. 

> “For something traveling at the speed of light, 56 microseconds is enough time to travel the distance of approximately 168 football fields,” (nearly **17 kilometers**) [said Cheryl Gramling](https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/moon/nasa-to-develop-lunar-time-standard-for-exploration-initiatives/), lead on lunar position, navigation, timing, and standards at NASA Headquarters in Washington. 

The infrastructure requirements create prohibitive deployment barriers. A functional lunar PNT constellation requires 4-6 satellites in complementary orbits—[either Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbits (NRHO) like those used by Gateway, or Elliptical Lunar Frozen Orbits (ELFO)](https://www.irjet.net/archives/V12/i3/IRJET-V12I301.pdf) employed by missions like Lunar Pathfinder. 

NASA’s Lunar Communications Relay and Navigation System (LCRNS) studies show that lunar comms and navigation infrastructure requires massive capital investment, effectively limiting independent deployment to well-funded national programs or coalitions.

[In 2024, Intuitive Machines (Houston, Texas) was competitively selected](https://spacenews.com/nasa-selects-intuitive-machines-for-lunar-communications-and-navigation-services/#:~:text=Those%20services%20would%20be%20used,to%20expand%20the%20lunar%20economy.%E2%80%9D) under NASA’s NSNS solicitation as the first commercial LCRNS provider, securing a contract valued at **up to $4.8 billion** to deliver lunar communications and navigation services in support of the Artemis program.

The PNT architecture itself comprises multiple interdependent layers: time transfer systems, reference frame definitions, navigation signal specifications, and integrity monitoring capabilities. Each layer presents opportunities for standard-setting that creates technical dependencies. The [LunaNet](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20250009447/downloads/LANS_Demo_ION_Paper_v1_3.pdf?attachment=true) Interoperability Specification (LNIS) being co-developed by NASA, ESA, and JAXA represents the most advanced effort to standardize these layers, with Version 5.0 establishing the Augmented Forward Signal (AFS) protocols that will enable cross-compatibility between national systems.

The control mechanisms embedded in technical standards extend beyond immediate operational concerns to create irreversible infrastructure dependencies. A lunar navigation constellation requires the $1B+ capital investment noted above, but the lock-in occurs through operational adoption. Once 10-15 plausible surface assets—habitats, rovers, resource extractors, landing pads—rely on a constellation's timing signals for precision operations, deploying an alternative constellation becomes economically irrational. The switching costs would include not only new space infrastructure but also ground segment upgrades, receiver replacements across all deployed assets, and operational procedure revisions.

The control mechanisms embedded in technical standards create irreversible infrastructure dependencies. While a lunar navigation constellation requires $1B+ in capital, the true lock-in is operational. Once 10–15 surface assets—ranging from robotic commercial landers to Artemis habitats—adopt a specific signal, the prohibitive costs of re-certifying mission software and ground segments make switching providers economically irrational.

Supposedly by 2030, these network effects will reach a tipping point. [New entrants will face a stark choice](https://spacesettlementprogress.com/a-vision-for-industry-on-the-moon/): pay a few million marginal cost to join the established network or attempt to capitalize a sovereign alternative at a cost exceeding 1 billion. The first mover to secure this adoption creates path dependencies that will dictate lunar frequencies, coordinate systems, and economic power for decades.

In a landscape likely bifurcating between US-led LunaNet and China-Russia International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) standards, [the first mover to secure widespread adoption effectively captures the unaligned market](https://spaceexplored.com/2025/09/15/artemis-vs-china-why-who-gets-to-the-moon-first-is-important/). This establishes path dependencies that entrench specific frequencies and coordinate systems, granting the standard-setter disproportionate influence over the future lunar economy.

### Evidence 3: Competitive Response Patterns

[China's parallel lunar program](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2025-11/Chapter_7--The_Final_Frontier_Chinas_Ambitions_to_Dominate_Space.pdf) represents the most significant challenge to US lunar PNT dominance. Beijing has explicitly rejected participation in the Artemis Accords and is developing independent capabilities through its International Lunar Research Station initiative with Russia. The 2024 launches of [Tiandu-1 and Tiandu-2 test satellites](http://english.scio.gov.cn/chinavoices/2024-04/16/content_117128068.htm) have already demonstrated operational lunar navigation payloads, validating China's technical approach and establishing a viable alternative architecture. This parallel track threatens to create competing technical standards that could fragment the lunar operating environment.

The spectrum coordination battleground adds another layer of complexity. The Space Frequency Coordination Group (SFCG) has [recommended the 2483.5-2500 MHz band for lunar PNT services](https://www.tesa.prd.fr/documents/26/2025-09_ion_gnss_for_ensuring_lunar_and_martian.pdf), but the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) coordination process for these frequencies presents potential friction points. Under [ITU Radio Regulations Article 9](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/space/WRS16space/ART-9.pdf), frequency assignments require coordination to avoid harmful interference. If China files competing lunar PNT frequency notifications, ITU procedures could force multilateral technical negotiations, potentially disrupting the US timeline for establishing operational precedent. However, the [ITU does not have the power](https://www.thespacereview.com/article/5044/1#:~:text=At%20the%20international%20level%2C%20the,for%20orbital%20and%20spectrum%20resources.) to sanction the deployed systems through "after-the-fact" coordination, which may allow US infrastructure to establish de facto standards before formal regulatory resolution.

The Western coalition presents a more nuanced picture than simple US dominance. [ESA and JAXA are core partners](https://bsgn.esa.int/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/06-Masaya_Murata_JAXA_presentation.pdf) in developing the LunaNet Interoperability Specification (LNIS), not independent competitors. ESA's Moonlight initiative and JAXA's Lunar Navigation Satellite System (LNSS) are designed for cross-compatibility with NASA's LCRNS through the shared Augmented Forward Signal protocols. This represents coordinated development of complementary systems rather than fragmentation.

However, this multilateral approach within the Artemis coalition introduces complexity. ESA and JAXA maintain parallel development efforts that provide them with autonomous capabilities even while committing to interoperability. This hedging strategy—cooperation with preserved independence—suggests that even close allies recognize the strategic implications of PNT infrastructure control and structure their participation to avoid complete dependence on US systems. The LNIS framework may thus create a Western PNT bloc rather than exclusive US control, though the US role in defining core specifications still provides first-mover advantages.

## Counter-Evidence / Risks

Despite US momentum, several factors could disrupt the establishment of dominant lunar PNT standards. Legal frameworks remain fragmented, with no clear international consensus on lunar governance. The [international governance models](https://moonvillageassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Report-International-Virtual-Workshop-on-Interoperability-and-Lunar-Activities-Database-19-June-2025.pdf) proposed by organizations like the Moon Village Association suggest alternative approaches that could prevent single-nation control through multilateral governance structures.

Existing multilateral mechanisms provide potential coordination pathways. The [UN Action Team on Lunar Activities Consultation (ATLAC)](https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/copuos/atlac/index.html#:~:text=The%20Action%20Team%20on%20Lunar%20Activities%20Consultation%20is%20to%20have,establishment%20of%20an%20international%20mechanism.) currently debates these standardization questions, while the [International Committee on GNSS (ICG)](https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/sk/ourwork/icg/icg.html) offers established working groups for "Interoperability and Coordination" that could extend to lunar PNT. These forums could evolve into governance structures resembling ICANN's multi-stakeholder model for internet infrastructure—a "Lunar ICANN" coordinating PNT standards through international consensus rather than first-mover dominance. However, the technical complexity of lunar PNT and the immediate operational needs of early missions create pressure for rapid standard adoption that may preclude such deliberative processes.

Critical data gaps remain regarding the technical feasibility of alternative PNT systems and the precise timeline for when standards become effectively "locked in" through infrastructure deployment. [The legal basis for enforcing technical standards in the lunar environment also remains untested](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/396712868_Artemis_Accord_-_A_Critical_Analysis_of_Global_Norm-Making_in_Outer_Space), creating uncertainty about whether operational precedent alone can establish binding norms.

## Conclusion

The evidence supports the hypothesis that the United States is pursuing first-mover advantage in lunar PNT standards through coordinated policy action and coalition building. The combination of technical leadership, diplomatic momentum through the Artemis Accords, and planned infrastructure deployment creates powerful path dependencies that will challenge competitors to overcome.

However, "irreversibility" depends on specific technical and political thresholds that remain uncertain. The critical juncture occurs when deployed infrastructure crosses the lock-in threshold—likely 5-7 major missions adopting compatible receivers by 2028-2029. Before this point, alternative outcomes remain viable: China's demonstrated Tiandu capabilities could sustain a parallel ecosystem; multilateral forums like ATLAC or ICG could establish negotiated interoperability frameworks; or ITU frequency coordination disputes could force technical compromises that dilute US control.

The most probable outcome may not be exclusive US dominance but rather a managed fragmentation: a Western LNIS bloc (US-ESA-JAXA) achieving de facto standardization among Artemis participants, with China establishing a separate but technically functional ILRS ecosystem. This bifurcation would mirror terrestrial GNSS competition between GPS/Galileo and BeiDou, creating redundancy while fragmenting the lunar operating environment. The window for influencing this outcome remains open but narrows with each infrastructure deployment decision made in the next 24-36 months.

## Implications & Next Steps

Policymakers and stakeholders must recognize that technical standards decisions made in the next 24-36 months will determine whether lunar PNT evolves toward unified standards or managed fragmentation. Key priorities include monitoring technical standards organization decisions in CCSDS, ATLAC, and ICG for signs of convergence or divergence, and identifying the specific inflection point when deployed infrastructure crosses the lock-in threshold of 5-7 major missions with compatible receivers.

Nations seeking to influence outcomes should assess their strategic options before this threshold is reached. For US allies, the LNIS framework offers participation in standard-setting while maintaining autonomous capabilities through parallel development. For non-aligned actors, the window for establishing credible alternative systems requires immediate constellation deployment decisions and frequency coordination filings with ITU.

Alternative governance models deserve urgent evaluation. Tracking whether China's Tiandu program can sustain a viable parallel ecosystem will indicate whether fragmented standards become permanent. Monitoring ITU frequency coordination proceedings may reveal opportunities for negotiated interoperability that could prevent bifurcation. The fundamental question is whether the lunar community will converge on common standards through multilateral coordination, fragment into competing blocs, or see US-led standards achieve de facto dominance through infrastructure deployment before governance mechanisms mature.
