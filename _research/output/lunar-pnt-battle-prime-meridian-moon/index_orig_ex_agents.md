# Lunar PNT: The Battle for the Prime Meridian of the Moon

## Hypothesis

The United States is leveraging first-mover advantage through the [Artemis Accords framework](https://doi.org/10.29202/asl/15/5) to establish de facto lunar positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) standards that will become irreversible once lunar infrastructure scales. This strategic maneuver aims to create long-term control over lunar economic activity by establishing technical standards that future actors will have no choice but to adopt. Much like the historical battle over Earth's prime meridian, whoever controls lunar PNT standards will shape the fundamental infrastructure of humanity's expansion beyond Earth.

## Why This Matters

Lunar PNT standards represent far more than technical specifications—they will determine who controls the fundamental infrastructure of [lunar economic control](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389206863_Geopolitical_Dynamics_of_Space_Resource_Exploitation_The_Case_of_Lunar_Mining). As lunar activities transition from exploration to exploitation, accurate positioning and timing systems become essential for everything from resource extraction to habitat construction. The nation or coalition that establishes these standards will enjoy significant advantages in coordinating lunar operations and potentially gatekeeping access to critical services.

Technical standards have emerged as powerful geopolitical weapons in the space domain, as the [geopolitical competition in space](https://trendsresearch.org/insight/orbital-rivalry-the-u-s-china-competition-and-the-future-of-the-global-space-economy/) increasingly plays out through seemingly neutral technical decisions. The fragmented nature of current space law creates opportunities for first-movers to establish de facto standards through operational precedent rather than formal treaty negotiations. This represents a critical infrastructure battleground where geopolitical competition, technological standards-setting, and economic opportunity converge in ways that will shape humanity's future in space for decades to come.

## Supporting Evidence

### Evidence 1: US Policy Leadership and Coalition Building

The United States has moved decisively to establish lunar PNT leadership through coordinated policy initiatives. The [Presidential directive on lunar time](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Celestial-Time-Standardization-Policy.pdf) issued in April 2024 mandates the development of lunar time standardization, marking the first national-level commitment to addressing this technical challenge. This directive was followed by the comprehensive [Lunar Reference System Policy](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Lunar-Reference-System-Policy.pdf), which establishes the technical framework for US lunar PNT capabilities.

More significantly, the Artemis Accords have created a [29+ nation coalition](https://doi.org/10.29202/asl/15/5) aligned with US standards and approaches to lunar activities. This coalition-building strategy ensures that US technical standards will be implemented across a significant portion of early lunar infrastructure. By embedding PNT standards within the broader Artemis framework, the US has created powerful network effects that make alternative standards increasingly costly to implement.

### Evidence 2: Technical Standards as Control Mechanisms

Technical standards organizations have emerged as [standards battlegrounds](https://ccsds.org/meetings/previousevents/2024spring/lunarforum/) where geopolitical competition plays out through ostensibly neutral technical decisions. The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) and other standards bodies now host intense negotiations over lunar PNT specifications, with national delegations pursuing technical choices that advance their strategic interests. These forums demonstrate how geopolitical competition increasingly manifests through technical standardization rather than traditional diplomatic channels.

The control mechanisms embedded in technical standards extend beyond immediate operational concerns. According to network effects theory, once a critical mass of infrastructure relies on particular standards, switching costs become prohibitive. This creates path dependencies that can lock in advantages for decades, making early standard-setting decisions disproportionately influential in shaping long-term power dynamics.

### Evidence 3: Competitive Response Patterns

[China's parallel lunar program](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2025-11/Chapter_7--The_Final_Frontier_Chinas_Ambitions_to_Dominate_Space.pdf) represents the most significant challenge to US lunar PNT dominance. Beijing has explicitly rejected participation in the Artemis Accords and is developing independent capabilities through its International Lunar Research Station initiative with Russia. This parallel track threatens to create competing technical standards that could fragment the lunar operating environment.

Meanwhile, [ESA's independent approach](https://www.unoosa.org/documents/pdf/icg/2024/WG-B_Lunar_PNT_Jun24/LunarPNT_Jun24_02_04.pdf) reflects Europe's pursuit of strategic autonomy in space. While European nations participate in Artemis, ESA continues developing independent lunar navigation capabilities through initiatives like Moonlight. This hedging strategy suggests that even US allies recognize the strategic implications of PNT control and seek to maintain some degree of independence.

## Counter-Evidence / Risks

Despite US momentum, several factors could disrupt the establishment of dominant lunar PNT standards. Legal frameworks remain fragmented, with no clear international consensus on lunar governance. The [international governance models](https://moonvillageassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Report-International-Virtual-Workshop-on-Interoperability-and-Lunar-Activities-Database-19-June-2025.pdf) proposed by organizations like the Moon Village Association suggest alternative approaches that could prevent single-nation control through multilateral governance structures.

The internet governance model offers a potential precedent for preventing unilateral control. Just as ICANN emerged to manage internet infrastructure through multi-stakeholder processes, a "Lunar ICANN" could potentially coordinate PNT standards through international consensus rather than first-mover dominance. However, the technical complexity of lunar PNT and the immediate operational needs of early missions create pressure for rapid standard adoption that may preclude such deliberative processes.

Critical data gaps remain regarding the technical feasibility of alternative PNT systems and the precise timeline for when standards become effectively "locked in" through infrastructure deployment. The legal basis for enforcing technical standards in the lunar environment also remains untested, creating uncertainty about whether operational precedent alone can establish binding norms.

## Conclusion

The evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that the United States is establishing an irreversible first-mover advantage in lunar PNT standards through coordinated policy action and coalition building. The combination of technical leadership, diplomatic momentum through the Artemis Accords, and early infrastructure deployment creates powerful path dependencies that will be difficult for competitors to overcome. This technical standardization battle represents a fundamental struggle for long-term control of lunar economic infrastructure, with implications extending far beyond immediate operational concerns.

## Implications & Next Steps

Policymakers and stakeholders must recognize that technical standards decisions made in the next 2-3 years will shape lunar governance for decades. Key priorities include monitoring technical standards organization decisions for signs of geopolitical maneuvering and identifying inflection points where particular standards become effectively irreversible. Assessing the timeline for when lunar infrastructure reaches a "lock-in" threshold will be critical for nations seeking to influence outcomes.

Alternative governance models deserve immediate evaluation before US standards become entrenched through operational precedent. Tracking Chinese technical capabilities and their timeline for independent lunar PNT deployment will indicate whether a fragmented standards environment might emerge. Finally, analyzing potential legal challenges that could disrupt US first-mover strategy may reveal opportunities for more inclusive governance approaches. The window for shaping lunar PNT standards remains open, but it is closing rapidly as operational missions create facts on the ground—or rather, on the Moon.
