| India | Neutral | BRICS coordination or technology sharing benefits | Medium |
| Russia | Neutral | Arms sales or geopolitical alignment opportunities | Low |

## Engagement Strategy Implications

### Key Players (High Power, High Interest)
| Stakeholder | Recommended Approach | Priority Actions |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Brazil | Collaborate | Formalize ALCE leadership role, joint capability development |
| AfSA | Partner | Institutional capacity building, coordination mechanisms |
| United States | Defend/Negotiate | Diplomatic engagement, demonstrate defensive nature |
| UN COPUOS | Leverage | Legal framework development, legitimacy building |

### Keep Satisfied (High Power, Low Interest)
| Stakeholder | Recommended Approach | Priority Actions |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------|
| China | Engage | Technology cooperation agreements, BRI space integration |
| EU/ESA | Inform | Multilateral space governance proposals |
| Private Space | Monitor | Regulatory clarity, market access assurances |

### Keep Informed (Low Power, High Interest)
| Stakeholder | Recommended Approach | Priority Actions |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------|
| African Union | Communicate | Regular briefings, policy alignment |
| CELAC | Include | Joint declarations, coordination meetings |
| South Africa | Leverage | Regional leadership role, BRICS coordination |

## Key Findings
1. **Capability Gap Challenge:** Regional organizations have high interest but limited independent space capabilities, creating dependence on external partners and vulnerability to pressure.
2. **Great Power Competition Opportunity:** US-China rivalry creates openings for regional coalitions to play powers against each other and secure better terms.
3. **Legitimacy Advantage:** UN frameworks and South-South cooperation narratives provide moral authority that established powers struggle to counter directly.

## Strategic Implications
The stakeholder landscape reveals both opportunity and challenge for AfSA-ALCE cooperation. While there's strong normative support for space sovereignty and regional autonomy, the initiative faces the fundamental challenge of limited indigenous capabilities. Success requires: (1) securing Chinese or other alternative technology sources, (2) maintaining unity despite diverse regional interests, (3) leveraging UN frameworks for legitimacy, and (4) managing inevitable US pressure through diplomatic and economic channels.

## Limitations
Analysis based on general knowledge of space governance and regional organizations. Specific positions of AfSA and ALCE leadership unknown. Internal dynamics within African Union and CELAC regarding space policy unclear. Private sector stakeholder positions assumed based on general market interests.
