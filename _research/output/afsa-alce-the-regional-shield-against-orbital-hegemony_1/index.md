# AfSA & ALCE: The Regional Shield Against Orbital Hegemony

## Bottom Line

The African Space Agency (AfSA) and Latin American and Caribbean Space Agency (ALCE) are actively constructing a defensive coalition designed to establish alternative space governance structures that challenge US-European orbital dominance. This strategic alignment represents more than a technical partnership—it embodies a fundamental shift toward "Sovereign Regionalism" in space governance, where maintaining political and economic autonomy takes precedence over rapid capability development. The success or failure of this Global South space alliance hinges critically on China's level of engagement, positioning Beijing as the decisive swing actor in reshaping the future of orbital governance, [utilizing the trialectics of spatiality as defined in the Global South spatial analysis](https://doi.org/10.1080/01436597.2020.1712999).

## Background

The African Union has systematically built institutional capacity for space governance through its comprehensive Space Policy Framework, [incorporating the governance models proposed in the African space governance framework](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsse.2025.11.001). This framework provides the regulatory backbone for continental coordination and represents Africa's first unified approach to space development. Simultaneously, Latin American space economies are experiencing unprecedented growth, with increasing investment flows and accelerating regional market development creating new opportunities for South-South cooperation.

Recent updates to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) regulatory framework have created legal pathways that enable regional space cooperation models previously constrained by traditional bilateral agreements. These regulatory changes, combined with evolving geopolitical dynamics, have opened windows for alternative governance structures. The landscape involves multiple stakeholders spanning regional institutions, established space powers, and multilateral organizations, each pursuing distinct strategic objectives that intersect in complex ways.

## Key Facts

Morphological analysis has revealed multiple theoretical governance configurations available to the AfSA-ALCE coalition, [applying the decision-support frameworks and technological milestones established in the governance analysis](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsse.2025.11.001). These viable options cluster into three distinct archetypes: "Sovereign Regionalism" emphasizing political autonomy, "Technology Partnership Hub" focusing on capability building through selective partnerships, and "Counter-Hegemonic Alliance" pursuing active resistance to established space powers. Each archetype presents unique trade-offs between autonomy, capability development, and implementation speed.

Global South actors, particularly AfSA, ALCE, and India, are demonstrating unprecedented coordination in seeking alternatives to established space governance structures, [as indicated by the cumulative strategic indices outlined in South-South cooperation analysis](https://doi.org/10.1080/01436597.2015.1108161). This coordination extends beyond rhetoric into concrete institutional mechanisms and shared technical standards. However, critical data gaps remain regarding specific economic investment commitments from member states, comprehensive technical capability assessments for regional space infrastructure, and detailed timelines for implementation phases.

## Implications

Traditional space powers face mounting pressure to fundamentally reconsider their engagement strategies with Global South regions, [as evidenced by the spatial network analysis of US-China structural power dynamics](https://doi.org/10.1093/isagsq/ksad067). The emergence of alternative governance models challenges the assumption that technological leadership automatically translates into regulatory control. Fundamental trade-offs have emerged between maintaining political and economic autonomy, building indigenous technical capabilities, and achieving rapid implementation of space programs—forcing regional actors to make difficult strategic choices.

The coalition's success depends heavily on China's level of support and engagement, particularly given Beijing's unique position as both a space power and Global South advocate. China's Third Policy Paper on Latin America and the Caribbean signals potential alignment with regional autonomy objectives, though concrete commitments remain ambiguous. If regional space governance develops in isolation from existing international frameworks, it risks creating a fragmented orbital environment with competing standards and potentially conflicting regulations that could undermine global space safety and sustainability.

## Recommended Action

Policymakers should prioritize monitoring China's strategic positioning and engagement level with the AfSA-ALCE coalition, as Beijing's decisions will likely determine whether this initiative becomes a genuine alternative or remains aspirational. Assessment of potential integration mechanisms between emerging regional frameworks and existing international space governance structures is critical to prevent destructive fragmentation. Economic sustainability models for long-term regional space cooperation require immediate evaluation, as financial viability remains the most significant constraint on Global South space ambitions. While specific policy recommendations await complete economic analysis, the strategic imperative is clear: established space powers must engage constructively with regional governance initiatives or risk accelerating the very fragmentation they seek to avoid.
