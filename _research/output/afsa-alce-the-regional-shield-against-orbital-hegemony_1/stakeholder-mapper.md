# Stakeholder Mapping: AfSA & ALCE Regional Space Governance Initiative

## Executive Summary
Analysis identified 28 relevant stakeholders across regional institutions, major space powers, emerging economies, and multilateral organizations. The landscape is characterized by a defensive coalition of Global South actors (AfSA, ALCE, India) seeking to create alternative governance structures against established US-European orbital dominance. China emerges as a critical swing actor whose support could determine the initiative's success, while traditional space powers face pressure to adapt their engagement strategies.

### Swing Actors
| Actor | Current Position | Could Swing If... | Strategic Value |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| China | Strategic Calculation | Clear influence benefits vs. multipolarity costs | High |
| Russia | Weak Support | Western space exclusion continues | Medium |
| UN COPUOS | Neutral | Regional blocs demonstrate governance effectiveness | Medium |

## Engagement Strategy Implications

### Key Players (High Power, High Interest)
| Stakeholder | Recommended Approach | Priority Actions |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------|
| China | Negotiate Strategic Partnership | Offer technology sharing, market access, influence recognition |
| AfSA | Collaborate Closely | Provide institutional capacity, technical support, legitimacy |
| ALCE | Coordinate Operations | Integrate disaster management, technology transfer programs |
| India | Strengthen Alliance | Expand technology partnerships, coordinate diplomatic positions |

### Keep Satisfied (High Power, Low Interest)
| Stakeholder | Recommended Approach | Priority Actions |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------|
| United States | Defensive Engagement | Demonstrate non-threatening nature, offer selective cooperation |
| European Union | Monitor and Adapt | Present alternative partnership models, avoid zero-sum framing |
| Russia | Opportunistic Coordination | Leverage shared interest in multipolarity |

### Keep Informed (Low Power, High Interest)
| Stakeholder | Recommended Approach | Priority Actions |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Brazil | Regional Leadership Role | Support ALCE leadership, provide platform visibility |
| South Africa | Continental Champion | Strengthen AfSA institutional capacity |
| UN COPUOS | Institutional Integration | Demonstrate compatibility with existing frameworks |

## Key Findings
1. **China as Decisive Swing Actor:** China's strategic calculation between influence expansion and multipolarity principles will determine whether regional blocs achieve genuine alternative governance or remain symbolic
2. **Defensive Coalition Strength:** [US-EU structural power remains dominant](https://doi.org/10.1093/isagsq/ksad067) but faces resource constraints and declining relative position in multipolar system
3. **Institutional Momentum:** [AfSA and ALCE represent genuine institutional development](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsse.2025.11.001) beyond traditional BRICS framework, with concrete technical cooperation programs

## Strategic Implications
The stakeholder map reveals a classic challenge to hegemonic stability, where rising regional powers seek alternative governance structures while established actors defend existing arrangements. Success depends on: (1) securing Chinese strategic partnership without compromising multipolarity narrative; (2) demonstrating concrete technical capabilities that provide genuine alternatives to Western systems; (3) maintaining Global South unity despite diverse national interests and capabilities.

## Limitations
Stakeholder positions based on institutional documents and strategic analysis; actual governmental positions may vary. Chinese strategic calculation particularly uncertain given competing priorities. Private sector engagement strategies unclear. Regional institution capacity assessments based on published frameworks rather than operational capabilities.
