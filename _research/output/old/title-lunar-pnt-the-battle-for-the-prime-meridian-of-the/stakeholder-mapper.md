# Stakeholder Mapping: Lunar PNT Systems and Navigation Standards

## Executive Summary
Analysis identified 18 key stakeholders in the emerging competition for lunar Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) standards. The landscape is dominated by a US-led coalition advancing NASA's LunaNet architecture, facing competition from China's independent lunar navigation development and European efforts for interoperability. The "prime meridian" battle reflects deeper questions about lunar governance, technical standards, and strategic autonomy in cislunar space.

### Keep Satisfied (High Power, Low Interest)
| Stakeholder | Recommended Approach | Priority Actions |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------|
| ROSCOSMOS | Monitor engagement | Assess post-ISS cooperation potential |
| ITU | Maintain technical dialogue | Ensure spectrum allocation compatibility |

### Keep Informed (Low Power, High Interest)

## Key Findings
1. **Bipolar Competition:** The lunar PNT landscape is crystallizing into US-led (LunaNet) vs. Chinese-led independent systems, with limited middle ground.
2. **European Swing Position:** ESA's position between cooperation and autonomy could determine whether a unified Western approach emerges or fragmentation occurs.
3. **Commercial Integration Critical:** Success of either approach depends on commercial sector adoption, making SpaceX and other companies key implementation partners.

## Strategic Implications
The "battle for the lunar prime meridian" reflects broader questions about space governance and technological standards. The outcome will determine whether lunar navigation follows an interoperable international model or fragments into competing regional systems. Early technical choices about coordinate systems, timing standards, and communication protocols will have lasting geopolitical implications for lunar commerce and exploration.

## Limitations
Limited visibility into classified Chinese lunar PNT development programs; ROSCOSMOS position uncertain due to geopolitical tensions; commercial company positions may shift based on market opportunities; international organization positions subject to member state consensus changes.
