# ============================================================================
# BEST PRACTICES FOR ANCHOR TEXT
# ============================================================================
#
# The anchor_suggestion field should provide natural text that can be embedded
# in prose, not just a citation label.
#
# ❌ BAD:  anchor_suggestion: "Boamah 2025"
# ✅ GOOD: anchor_suggestion: "according to Boamah's critical analysis"
#
# ❌ BAD:  anchor_suggestion: "NASA 2024"
# ✅ GOOD: anchor_suggestion: "as detailed in NASA's 2024 architecture white paper"
#
# The LLM will weave these into sentences naturally:
# "The LunaNet infrastructure, as detailed in NASA's 2024 architecture white paper,
#  provides delay-tolerant networking for seamless communications."

# ============================================================================
# TIPS FOR WRITING EFFECTIVE anchor_suggestion TEXT
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. INCLUDE THE AUTHOR/ORGANIZATION:
#    ✅ "according to Boamah's analysis"
#    ✅ "as NASA's white paper details"
#    ✅ "per ESA's strategic vision"
#
# 2. ADD DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT:
#    ✅ "according to the CCSDS standards body"
#    ✅ "as outlined in the White House policy directive"
#    ✅ "per Israel et al.'s LunaNet architecture study"
#
# 3. USE NATURAL PHRASES:
#    ✅ "as demonstrated by..."
#    ✅ "according to recent analysis from..."
#    ✅ "detailed in the..."
#    ✅ "as argued in..."
#    ✅ "per the specifications outlined by..."
#
# 4. CONSIDER THE SENTENCE FLOW:
#    The anchor text should read naturally when inserted mid-sentence:
#    "The time standard, as mandated in the White House's April 2024 policy directive,
#     must maintain tracciability to UTC while operating independently."
#
# 5. AVOID REDUNDANCY:
#    Don't repeat information that's already in the title:
#    ❌ "according to the Policy on Celestial Time Standardization policy"
#    ✅ "as mandated in the White House's April 2024 policy directive"
#
