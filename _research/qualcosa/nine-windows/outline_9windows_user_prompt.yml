task: "Creating a Comprehensive Article Outline based on the TRIZ 9-Windows Tool"
audience: 
  - "professional"
  - "policy makers"
  - "space enthusiast"
context: |
  - The Nine Windows (or System Operator) is a powerful analytical tool from TRIZ methodology that helps examine problems across different system levels and time periods. This tool uses a 3x3 matrix to analyze a system through two dimensions: temporal (past, present, 
  future) and hierarchical (subsystem, system, supersystem).
  - The article should be structured with three main sections based on the temporal dimension (Past, Present, Future) with each section containing three subsections based on the system hierarchy dimension (Subsystem, System, Supersystem), following the specific context in space_domain_taxonomy below

instructions: |
  - Create a detailed article on {title}. 
  - Follow strict output_loop and output_blueprint
  - Use verbose points style
  - Exclude: ["Introduction", "Conclusion"]
  - Provide only the final result of your work in JSON code. Do not add any conversation or extra explanation.

output_loop: |
  loop until have been created:
    all sections:
      - "Past: Understanding System Evolution"
      - "Present: Analyzing Current System Dynamics"
      - "Future: Predicting System Development"
    and for each section, related subsections:
      - "Subsystem Level Analysis"
      - "System Level Analysis"
      - "Supersystem Level Analysis"
    and for each subsection,related points
