# Minto Pyramid Templates

## Core Structure

The Minto Pyramid Principle: Start with the answer, then group supporting arguments.

```

## SCQA Framework (Introduction)

### S - Situation
The undeniable current state everyone agrees on.
- Start from stable, accepted context
- No controversy, just facts
- Sets the stage

**Template**: "Currently, [domain] is characterized by [accepted facts]."

### C - Complication
What has changed or emerged that demands attention.
- The problem, challenge, or opportunity
- Why the status quo is insufficient
- Creates tension

**Template**: "However, [change/problem/trend] has created [consequence]."

### Q - Question
The implicit or explicit question the reader now has.
- Logically follows from S+C
- The question your document answers

**Template**: "Given this, [how/what/should we] [action/decision]?"

### A - Answer
Your main recommendation or conclusion.
- Direct, clear, actionable
- The pyramid's apex

**Template**: "[Stakeholder] should [action] to achieve [outcome]."

## 3×3×3 Report Structure

### Executive Summary
- S-C-Q-A compressed into 1 paragraph
- Key recommendation upfront
- 3 bullet points for main arguments

### Section 1: [Primary Argument]
Supports the main recommendation most directly.

- **1.1**: [Specific evidence/analysis]
- **1.2**: [Specific evidence/analysis]
- **1.3**: [Specific evidence/analysis]

### Section 2: [Secondary Argument]
Provides additional support or addresses concerns.

- **2.1**: [Specific evidence/analysis]
- **2.2**: [Specific evidence/analysis]
- **2.3**: [Specific evidence/analysis]

### Section 3: [Forward-Looking/Implementation]
Shows path forward or consequences.

- **3.1**: [Specific evidence/analysis]
- **3.2**: [Specific evidence/analysis]
- **3.3**: [Specific evidence/analysis]

### Recommendations/Roadmap
- Who does What by When
- Resource requirements
- Success metrics

## Structure Selection Guide

### Structure A: Alternatives
Use when scenarios are **mutually exclusive**.

```
Answer: Choose Scenario X

Argument 1: Why X is best
├── Evidence: Advantage 1
├── Evidence: Advantage 2
└── Evidence: Advantage 3

Argument 2: Why not Y
├── Evidence: Disadvantage 1
├── Evidence: Disadvantage 2
└── Evidence: Disadvantage 3

Argument 3: Why not Z
├── Evidence: Disadvantage 1
├── Evidence: Disadvantage 2
└── Evidence: Disadvantage 3
```

### Structure B: Integrated Components
Use when scenarios are **compatible pillars**.

```
Answer: Implement integrated approach with 3 pillars

Pillar 1: [Scenario X contribution]
├── Implementation details
├── Requirements
└── Expected outcomes

Pillar 2: [Scenario Y contribution]
├── Implementation details
├── Requirements
└── Expected outcomes

Pillar 3: [Scenario Z contribution]
├── Implementation details
├── Requirements
└── Expected outcomes

Integration: How pillars work together
```

## Quality Checklist

### Does the Introduction (SCQA)...
- [ ] Start with accepted facts?
- [ ] Present a clear complication?
- [ ] Imply an obvious question?
- [ ] Answer that question directly?

### Does Each Section...
- [ ] Support the main answer?
- [ ] Have exactly 3 subsections?
- [ ] Progress logically?
- [ ] Contain concrete evidence?

### Does the Conclusion...
- [ ] Restate the recommendation?
- [ ] Provide actionable next steps?
- [ ] Specify responsibilities?
- [ ] Include timelines?

## Example SCQA for Space Domain

**Situation**: Europe relies heavily on third-party launch services for critical space missions.

**Complication**: Recent geopolitical shifts have created uncertainty about continued access to these services, while European commercial launch capacity remains limited.

**Question**: How should Europe ensure sovereign access to space over the next decade?

**Answer**: Europe should pursue a three-pillar strategy combining enhanced Ariane development, commercial partnership frameworks, and strategic stockpiling of launch capacity.
