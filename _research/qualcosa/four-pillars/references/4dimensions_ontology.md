# 4Dimensions© Ontology Reference

## Overview

The 4Dimensions© framework classifies entities through the intersection of:
- **4 Aristotelian Causes** (rows): Material, Formal, Efficient, Final
- **4 Systemic Levels** (columns): Foundational, Subsystem, System, Supersystem

This creates a 16-cell matrix that comprehensively maps any domain.

## The Four Causes

### Material Cause (Assets/Technologies)
**What things are made of.**

- Physical hardware, raw materials, components
- Energy sources, spectrum, orbital slots
- Infrastructure, facilities, equipment
- Test benches and laboratories (Material/Formal composites)

**NOT Material**: Software, algorithms, procedures (these are Formal)

### Formal Cause (Architecture/Frameworks)
**How things are organized.**

- Software, algorithms, data models
- Engineering specifications, standards
- Legal frameworks, treaties, policies
- Procedures, protocols, interfaces
- Organizational structures, business models

**Key Rule**: Software and algorithms are ALWAYS Formal, never Material.

### Efficient Cause (Operators/Stakeholders)
**Who brings things about.**

- Human individuals and roles
- Organizations, agencies, companies
- Governments, regulatory bodies
- International consortia

**STRICT RULE**: Only humans and human organizations qualify as Efficient causes.
- AI systems, robots, automated processes are NEVER Efficient causes
- Autonomous systems are Material+Formal composites operated by humans

### Final Cause (Mission/Purposes)
**Why things exist.**

- Strategic objectives and missions
- Societal benefits and public goods
- Commercial value generation
- Scientific advancement
- Security and defense goals

## The Four Levels

### Foundational Level
**Universal substrates and principles.**

- Physical constants and natural laws
- Basic research and fundamental science
- Foundational standards and regulations
- Educational institutions
- Commons preservation

**Examples**:
- Electromagnetic spectrum (Material)
- Physical laws and mathematical constants (Formal)
- Standards organizations (Efficient)
- Advancing fundamental understanding (Final)

### Subsystem Level
**Components and building blocks.**

- Individual parts, modules, equipment
- Specifications and interface documents
- Engineers, scientists, specialists
- Functional performance goals

**Examples**:
- Propulsion modules, sensors (Material)
- Interface control documents (Formal)
- Manufacturing specialists (Efficient)
- Ensuring reliable component operation (Final)

### System Level
**Integrated platforms and operations.**

- Complete vehicles, stations, facilities
- Mission architectures, operational procedures
- Space agencies, operators, integrators
- Operational capabilities

**Examples**:
- Satellites, launch vehicles (Material)
- Mission architectures (Formal)
- Space agencies, private companies (Efficient)
- Conducting space-based research (Final)

### Supersystem Level
**Networks, ecosystems, governance.**

- Constellations, global networks
- International treaties, strategic doctrines
- Governments, international organizations
- Civilizational objectives

**Examples**:
- Satellite mega-constellations (Material)
- International space treaties (Formal)
- UN COPUOS, ITU (Efficient)
- Advancing human presence in space (Final)

## Common Errors to Avoid

### Error 1: Placing Software in Material
❌ Wrong: "AI algorithms" in Material/System
✅ Correct: "AI algorithms" in Formal/System

### Error 2: Placing Organizations in Formal
❌ Wrong: "NASA governance" in Formal/Supersystem
✅ Correct: "NASA" in Efficient/System, "Governance frameworks" in Formal/Supersystem

### Error 3: Treating AI as Efficient Cause
❌ Wrong: "Autonomous systems" in Efficient/System
✅ Correct: "Autonomous systems" split between Material (hardware) and Formal (software)

### Error 4: Mixing Levels
❌ Wrong: "Orbital mechanics" in Formal/System
✅ Correct: "Orbital mechanics" in Formal/Foundational (universal principle)

## Matrix Template

| ↓Cause\Level→ | Foundational | Subsystem | System | Supersystem |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Material** | Universal substrates | Components | Platforms | Networks |
| **Formal** | Laws/Principles | Specifications | Architectures | Treaties/Policies |
| **Efficient** | Standards bodies | Specialists | Operators | Coordinators |
| **Final** | Commons | Performance | Capabilities | Civilization |

## Application Guidelines

1. **Start with Material**: Identify physical assets first
2. **Map Formal**: What organizes/structures the Material?
3. **Identify Efficient**: Who operates/creates these?
4. **Articulate Final**: What purposes do they serve?
5. **Check Level**: Is this foundational, component, system, or network level?
6. **Validate**: Cross-check against the rules above
