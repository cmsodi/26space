# TRIZ Principles Reference

## Overview

TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) resolves contradictions where improving one parameter worsens another. Instead of compromising, TRIZ finds solutions that satisfy both requirements.

## Contradiction Format

**Technical Contradiction**: Improving Parameter A worsens Parameter B
- Example: "Increasing payload capacity reduces fuel efficiency"

**Physical Contradiction**: A parameter must be both high AND low
- Example: "Wing must be large (lift) and small (speed)"

## Most Useful Principles for Strategic Analysis

### #1 Segmentation
**Divide an object or system into independent parts.**

- Break monolithic system into modules
- Create distributed architecture
- Enable parallel development tracks

*Strategic Example*: Instead of one massive satellite, use constellation of smaller ones.

### #2 Taking Out (Extraction)
**Extract the disturbing part or property.**

- Separate conflicting functions
- Isolate problematic elements
- Remove bottlenecks

*Strategic Example*: Separate commercial services from strategic assets.

### #10 Preliminary Action (Action in Advance)
**Perform required changes in advance.**

- Pre-position assets
- Build capability before need arises
- Establish frameworks early

*Strategic Example*: Develop redundant systems before single-point-of-failure emerges.

### #13 The Other Way Round (Inversion)
**Invert the action or process.**

- Instead of moving object, move environment
- Reverse the sequence
- Challenge assumptions about direction

*Strategic Example*: Instead of protecting assets, make them rapidly replaceable.

### #15 Dynamics
**Allow characteristics to change for optimal performance.**

- Adaptive systems
- Reconfigurable architectures
- Flexible policies

*Strategic Example*: Modular satellite that can change mission profile on orbit.

### #17 Another Dimension
**Move to additional dimensions.**

- Utilize 3D instead of 2D
- Use time as additional dimension
- Layer systems

*Strategic Example*: Multi-orbit architecture (LEO + MEO + GEO) instead of single plane.

### #25 Self-Service
**Make the object serve and repair itself.**

- Autonomous maintenance
- Self-healing systems
- Built-in redundancy

*Strategic Example*: Satellite with autonomous collision avoidance.

### #35 Parameter Changes
**Change the physical state or concentration.**

- Alter form factor
- Change operational mode
- Shift phase/state

*Strategic Example*: Virtual constellation using software-defined payloads.

### #40 Composite Materials
**Use composite materials instead of homogeneous.**

- Hybrid architectures
- Multi-source integration
- Diverse technology mix

*Strategic Example*: Commercial + governmental + allied assets in unified network.

## Application Process

### Step 1: Identify the Contradiction
State clearly: "We want [Parameter A] to be high, but this makes [Parameter B] low."

### Step 2: Select Candidate Principles
Choose 2-3 principles that seem applicable.

### Step 3: Generate Solutions
For each principle, ask: "How could this resolve our contradiction?"

### Step 4: Evaluate Feasibility
Check against constraints (budget, time, technology readiness).

### Step 5: Select Best Solution
Choose the solution that best resolves the contradiction within constraints.
