  core_evidence: "Standard EO pipeline stages and typical delay sources; cloud vs. on-prem trade-offs."
  analytical_angle: "Many vendors sell \"near-real-time\" without publishing latency distributions. Buyers should demand percentile metrics."
  deep_prompt: "Write a POR guide to building a latency budget. Include a sample table (stage, median, P95, dependency) and procurement guidance on how to contract for latency."

  title: "Performance Limits in SmallSats: Power, Thermal, and Pointing as the Real Constraints"
  core_evidence: "Typical CubeSat/SmallSat constraints: power generation, battery cycling, thermal dissipation, ADCS jitter."
  analytical_angle: "SmallSat success is about margins. Performance claims must be mapped to power/thermal/pointing budgets."
  deep_prompt: "Draft a BLUF explainer showing how to sanity-check payload performance claims against bus constraints. Include a checklist for power and thermal budgets and ADCS requirements."

  title: "AIT as a Schedule Weapon: The Hidden Critical Path in Commercial Space Programs"
  core_evidence: "Common AIT constraints: facility availability, test campaign sequencing, NCR closure cycles, configuration control."
  analytical_angle: "AIT is where optimistic plans go to die. Mature programs treat AIT capacity like production capacity."
  deep_prompt: "Write a POR playbook for managing AIT. Include a critical-path map, risk register categories, and tactics: early interface freeze, test-as-you-fly discipline, and supplier readiness gates."

  title: "Interfaces Kill Missions: ICD Discipline and the Cost of Late Changes"
  core_evidence: "Common integration issues: connector pinouts, timing, packet formats, RF compatibility, thermal/mechanical envelopes."
  analytical_angle: "In space systems, interfaces are the real product. ICD maturity is the best predictor of integration success."
  deep_prompt: "Draft a Minto-style guide to ICD discipline. Provide templates, change-control rules, and metrics to track interface stability over time."

  title: "Testing for Space Cyber: Why Pen-Tests Alone Don't Prove Mission Resilience"
  core_evidence: "Typical security testing components: threat modeling, red teaming, logging, key management, recovery drills."
  analytical_angle: "Cyber performance is measured by detection and recovery under constraints, not by \"no findings\" reports."
  deep_prompt: "Write a POR guide for buyers and operators. Define a minimal evidence set for cyber readiness, including tabletop exercises, on-orbit update procedures, and key custody audits."

  title: "Ground Station Network Design: Coverage vs. Cost vs. Sovereignty Trade-Offs"
  core_evidence: "Common architectures: single-site, multi-site, federated networks; cost drivers: antennas, ops, backhaul, automation."
  analytical_angle: "The best technical network can be politically unusable. Sovereignty constraints must be designed in from day one."
  deep_prompt: "Write a POR analysis with architecture options, a cost/performance table, and procurement guidance. Include how to contract for data residency, auditability, and continuity."

  title: "The \"Last Mile\" of Space Data: Delivery Performance, APIs, and Reliability Engineering"
  core_evidence: "Common reliability engineering practices: SLOs, observability, incident postmortems, data lineage systems."
  analytical_angle: "EO is becoming an infrastructure service. Reliability engineering is now a differentiator as important as sensor quality."
  deep_prompt: "Draft a BLUF for CTOs describing how to design the EO \"data last mile.\" Include recommended SLOs, observability metrics, and a minimal incident response playbook."
