  ## About Section

  Independent researcher focused on strategic analysis of space programs, governance, and industry dynamics. My work bridges engineering methodology with policy thinking—applying structured analytical frameworks to problems that resist simple solutions.

  Three decades in the space sector, including 31 years at the Italian Space Agency (ASI), provided direct experience of how institutions, programs, and policies actually function. Roles spanning project management, strategy, public affairs, and space security advisory offered multiple perspectives on the same domain—technical, political, institutional, international.

  Today I operate without institutional affiliations, enabling independent assessment free from organizational constraints. My analysis draws on a methodology that integrates ontological frameworks, morphological analysis (Zwicky), TRIZ, and structured communication principles—tools developed through three years of systematic research on augmenting strategic thinking with Large Language Models.

  Background combines electronic engineering (satellite telecommunications, Earth observation systems) with classical humanities education—a combination that shapes attention to both technical substance and the strategic, political, and philosophical dimensions often overlooked in purely technical assessments.

  Current work is published on two complementary platforms: → spacestrategies.org — Analytical frameworks and methodologies → spacepolicies.com — Applied analysis, articles, and monographs
