# About Space Strategies

Space Strategies provides analytical frameworks and methodologies for strategic thinking in the space domain. The site serves professionals, executives, and policy-makers who need rigorous tools to analyze complex decisions—not ready-made answers, but structured approaches to find their own.

## What You'll Find Here

**Original Research** — The *4Dimensions©* framework, an ontological structure for strategic analysis rooted in Aristotelian thought (material, formal, efficient, final causes across four systemic levels). This framework integrates with Zwicky's Morphological Analysis for systematic option generation, TRIZ for contradiction resolution, and the Minto Pyramid Principle for structured communication. The four pillars form a coherent methodology: from understanding what exists, to exploring what is possible, to overcoming obstacles, to communicating conclusions effectively. Large Language Models serve as augmentation tools within this framework—enhancing analytical rigor while preserving intellectual autonomy. Methodological reports document both the approach and its limits.

**Frameworks** — Strategic analysis methodologies adapted for the space domain, organized across six analytical dimensions: macro-environmental context (PESTLE, geopolitical theory), capability and power assessment (SWOT, instruments of power), stakeholder dynamics, threat and vulnerability analysis, future foresight (scenario planning, three horizons), and structured problem-solving (morphological analysis, Six Thinking Hats). Each framework includes guidance on when and how to apply it.

**Tutorials** — Step-by-step guides on applying these methodologies to real space sector problems, from spacecraft design trade-offs to institutional strategy.

**Reports** — Methodological research on integrating Large Language Models with strategic analysis frameworks, exploring how AI tools can augment (not replace) human judgment in complex domains.

## Applied Analysis

For concrete applications of these frameworks—articles, monographs, and scenario analyses on current space policy issues—see the companion site [spacepolicies.com](https://spacepolicies.com). The two sites are designed to work together: methods here, results there. Each analysis on Space Policies links back to the framework that informed it.

## The Founder

![Cesare Sodi](/images/founder-sketch.webp)

**Cesare Sodi** is an independent researcher with three decades of experience in the space sector, including positions at the Italian Space Agency (ASI) as Project Manager, Chief of Strategy and Public Relations, and advisor on Space Security.

His background spans microwave research, electronic systems design, satellite telecommunications, and Earth observation programs. A Master's degree in Electronic Engineering from La Sapienza University grounds his technical work; a classical education informs his approach to strategic and philosophical inquiry.

Since leaving institutional roles, Sodi has focused on developing analytical frameworks that bridge engineering methodology with strategic thinking. This work includes three years of systematic research on Large Language Models as tools for augmenting critical analysis—exploring both their potential and their limits.

He holds no current affiliations with space agencies or institutions, enabling independent assessment free from institutional constraints.
