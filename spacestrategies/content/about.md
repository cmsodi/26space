# About Space Strategies

Space Strategies provides analytical frameworks and methodologies for strategic thinking in the space domain. The site serves professionals, executives, and policy-makers who need rigorous tools to analyze complex decisions—not pre-packaged answers, but structured approaches to find their own.

## What You'll Find Here

**Original Research** — The 4Dimensions© framework, an ontological structure for strategic analysis rooted in Aristotelian thought (material, formal, efficient, final causes across four systemic levels). This framework integrates with Zwicky's Morphological Analysis for systematic option generation, TRIZ for contradiction resolution, and Minto's Pyramid Principle for structured communication. The four pillars form a coherent methodology: from understanding what exists, to exploring what's possible, to overcoming obstacles, to communicating conclusions effectively. Large Language Models serve as augmentation tools within this framework—enhancing analytical rigor while preserving intellectual autonomy. Methodological reports document both the approach and its limitations.

**Frameworks** — Twenty-four strategic analysis methodologies adapted for the space domain, organized across six analytical categories:

- **Macro-Environmental Analysis** (PESTLE, classical geopolitical theories, causal layered analysis)
- **Capabilities & Power Assessment** (SWOT, national power tools, hard/soft/smart power, security sector analysis)
- **Relationship & Stakeholder Dynamics** (alliance analysis, stakeholder power-interest mapping, levels of analysis)
- **Security & Threat Assessment** (threat risk matrices, red team/blue team exercises, war-gaming)
- **Future Foresight & Scenario Planning** (scenario planning, Delphi method, three horizons, futures wheel, cross-impact analysis)
- **Structured Thinking & Problem Solving** (six thinking hats, morphological analysis, SCAMPER, forced analogies)

Each framework includes space-specific translation (how orbital mechanics and institutional structures reshape the methodology), failure mode analysis (where the framework breaks or misleads), and integration guidance (which other frameworks complement it). The emphasis is critical—exposing limitations rather than overselling applicability.

## Space Strategy Hub (SSP Hub)

Space Strategies is part of **SSP Hub**, which integrates strategic methodology and policy analysis:

- **Space Strategies** → Methodological frameworks, tools, analytical rigor
- **Space Policies** → Articles, monographs, scenarios on current policy issues

The two sites work together: rigorous methodology here, applied results in [spacepolicies.org](https://spacepolicies.org). Each Space Policies analysis links back to the framework that structured it; each framework page includes example applications.

Frameworks are used in Space Policies based on their applicability:
- **Blog-Native**: fully executable with open source intelligence
- **Adapted Analysis**: require methodological simplification but provide partial insights without restricted access
- **Illustration of case studies**: too resource-intensive for original execution; explained through historical case analysis and examples

## The Founder

{{< figure src="/images/founder.webp" align="left" width-pc="30" width-mobile="40" alt="Cesare Sodi" >}}


**Cesare Sodi** is an independent researcher with three decades of experience in the space sector, including positions at the Italian Space Agency (ASI) as Project Manager, Chief of Strategy and Public Relations, and advisor on Space Security.

His background spans microwave research, electronic systems design, satellite telecommunications, and Earth observation programs. A Master's degree in Electronic Engineering from La Sapienza University grounds his technical work; a classical education informs his approach to strategic and philosophical inquiry.

Since leaving institutional roles, Sodi has focused on developing analytical frameworks that bridge engineering methodology with strategic thinking. This work includes three years of systematic research on Large Language Models as tools for augmenting critical analysis—exploring both their potential and their limits.

He holds no current affiliations with space agencies or institutions, enabling independent assessment free from institutional constraints.
