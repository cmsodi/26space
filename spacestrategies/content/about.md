# About Space Strategies

Space Strategies provides analytical frameworks and methodologies for strategic thinking in the space domain. The site serves professionals, executives, and policy-makers who need rigorous tools to analyze complex decisions—not ready-made answers, but structured approaches to find their own.

## What You'll Find Here

**Original Research** — The 4Dimensions© framework, an ontological structure for strategic analysis rooted in Aristotelian thought (material, formal, efficient, final causes across four systemic levels). This framework integrates with Zwicky's Morphological Analysis for systematic option generation, TRIZ for contradiction resolution, and the Minto Pyramid Principle for structured communication. The four pillars form a coherent methodology: from understanding what exists, to exploring what is possible, to overcoming obstacles, to communicating conclusions effectively. Large Language Models serve as augmentation tools within this framework—enhancing analytical rigor while preserving intellectual autonomy. Methodological reports document both the approach and its limits.

**Frameworks** — Twenty-four strategic analysis methodologies adapted for the space domain, organized across six analytical categories:

- **Macro-Environmental Analysis** (PESTLE, classical geopolitical theories, causal layered analysis)
- **Capabilities & Power Assessment** (SWOT, instruments of national power, hard/soft/smart power, security sector analysis)
- **Relationship & Stakeholder Dynamics** (alliance analysis, stakeholder power-interest mapping, levels of analysis)
- **Security & Threat Assessment** (threat risk matrices, red team/blue team exercises, war-gaming)
- **Future Foresight & Scenario Planning** (scenario planning, Delphi method, three horizons, futures wheel, cross-impact analysis)
- **Structured Thinking & Problem Solving** (six thinking hats, morphological analysis, SCAMPER, forced analogies)

Each framework includes space-specific translation (how orbital mechanics and institutional structures reshape the methodology), failure mode analysis (where the framework breaks down or misleads), and integration guidance (which other frameworks complement it). The emphasis is critical—exposing limitations rather than overselling applicability.

## Applied Analysis

For concrete applications of these frameworks—articles, monographs, and scenario analyses on current space policy issues—see the companion site [spacepolicies.org](https://spacepolicies.org).

Frameworks are used in [spacepolicies.org](https://spacepolicies.org) based on their applicability:

- **Blog-Native**: fully executable with open source intelligence;
- **Adapted Analysis**: require methodological simplification, but provide partial insights without restricted access. Used for more in-depth analysis.
- **Illustration of case studies**: too resource-intensive for original execution; explained through analysis of historical cases and examples.

The two sites work together: rigorous methodology here, applied results there. Each Space Policies analysis links back to the framework that structured it, and each framework page includes example applications.

## The Founder

{{< figure src="/images/founder.webp" align="left" width-pc="30" width-mobile="40" alt="Cesare Sodi" >}}

**Cesare Sodi**

Cesare Sodi is an independent researcher with three decades of experience in the space sector, including positions at the Italian Space Agency (ASI) as Project Manager, Chief of Strategy and Public Relations, and advisor on Space Security.

His background spans microwave research, electronic systems design, satellite telecommunications, and Earth observation programs. A Master's degree in Electronic Engineering from La Sapienza University grounds his technical work; a classical education informs his approach to strategic and philosophical inquiry.

Since leaving institutional roles, Sodi has focused on developing analytical frameworks that bridge engineering methodology with strategic thinking. This work includes three years of systematic research on Large Language Models as tools for augmenting critical analysis—exploring both their potential and their limits.

He holds no current affiliations with space agencies or institutions, enabling independent assessment free from institutional constraints.
