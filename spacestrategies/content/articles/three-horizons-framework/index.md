## 1. Methodological Genesis & Core Logic

Developed by Baghai, Coley & White at McKinsey (1999) for corporate portfolio management, later adapted by International Futures Forum (2005) for futures thinking, **Three Horizons** visualizes innovation as temporally stratified layers rather than linear progression.

* **Space Translation:** Space programs exhibit extreme temporal dispersion—simultaneously operating mature GEO communication satellites (H1), developing reusable launch systems (H2), and researching fusion propulsion (H3). Three Horizons provides a cognitive map for organizations managing this chrono-complexity without forcing false choice between "exploit vs. explore."
* **Epistemological Function:** Produces **transition literacy**—the capacity to recognize when H1 paradigms are collapsing, H2 innovations are maturing, and H3 visions require activation. Unlike scenario planning (which explores alternative futures), Three Horizons assumes a *specific* trajectory of paradigm succession.
* **Core Logic:** Innovation doesn't replace the present instantly; it gestates in the future while the present decays. The "present" (H1) contains seeds of its own obsolescence; the "future" (H3) exists in embryonic form *now*. Strategic failure occurs when organizations mistake H1 for permanence or H3 for fantasy.
* **Critical Limitation:** Three Horizons is *not* a prediction tool—it's a sensemaking framework. It cannot tell you *which* H3 visions will succeed, only that *some* transformation is inevitable and that H2 is the critical transition battleground.

## 2. Structural Components

The framework operates through three overlapping temporal curves with specific functional roles:

### **Horizon 1: The Dominant Paradigm**
- **Definition:** Current business model, institutional structures, and prevailing worldview
- **Temporal Signature:** Peak performance → plateau → decline (typically 5-15 year arc visible at analysis time)
- **Space Example (2025):** 
  - GEO telecommunications satellites
  - Expendable launch vehicles for flagship science missions
  - Government-led national space programs
- **Organizational Dynamics:**
  - Commands 80-90% of budget and executive attention
  - Defined success metrics (revenue, mission success rate, TRL progression)
  - Incumbent stakeholders defend against disruption (cognitive conservatism + vested interests)
- **Warning Signal:** When H1 generates declining marginal returns despite increased investment
- **Managerial Trap:** Confusing *profitability* with *sustainability*. H1 can be highly profitable even as it approaches obsolescence (see: Kodak's film business, 2000-2005).

### **Horizon 2: The Transition Zone**
- **Definition:** Innovations that disrupt H1 while not yet fully mature; characterized by entrepreneurial activity, regulatory uncertainty, and business model experimentation
- **Temporal Signature:** Exponential growth potential but high variance (5-15 years to H1 parity)
- **Space Example (2025):**
  - LEO mega-constellations (Starlink, OneWeb, Kuiper)
  - Commercial space stations (Axiom, Orbital Reef)
  - Reusable launch systems achieving rapid cadence
- **Organizational Dynamics:**
  - Receives 10-20% of budget (the "innovation portfolio")
  - Metrics are ambiguous (not yet proven, not fully failed)
  - High organizational tension: H2 advocates claim urgency; H1 defenders demand proof
  - Most strategic conflict occurs in H2 resource allocation battles
- **Critical Function:** H2 is not simply "future H1"—it's a *translation layer* where H3 visions are operationalized into viable business models
- **Managerial Challenge:** Premature scaling (treating H2 as H1 before product-market fit) or perpetual piloting (never graduating H2 to H1)

### **Horizon 3: The Emergent Future**
- **Definition:** Visionary concepts that appear speculative today but encode fundamentally different paradigms; exist as prototypes, research programs, or thought experiments
- **Temporal Signature:** 15-30+ years to mainstream adoption (if ever)
- **Space Example (2025):**
  - Lunar/asteroid resource economy ("space as resource extraction site")
  - Autonomous space manufacturing ("orbital industrial base")
  - Multi-generational interstellar missions ("post-planetary civilization")
- **Organizational Dynamics:**
  - Receives 1-5% of budget (R&D, futures teams, skunkworks)
  - No conventional ROI metrics; success = maintaining optionality
  - Socially marginalized within organization ("nice hobby" perception)
- **Strategic Function:** H3 is *not* prediction—it's **hypothesis space**. Organizations cultivate multiple H3 visions knowing most will fail, but one may define the next H1.
- **Failure Mode:** Treating H3 as entertainment ("cool tech demos") rather than serious strategic exploration

### **The Inflection Dynamics**
- **H1→H2 Transition ("Disruption Point"):** When H2 innovation achieves cost/performance parity with H1, triggering sudden market shift
- **H2→H3 Pull ("Vision Activation"):** When H2 success creates conditions (infrastructure, capital, talent) that make H3 experiments viable
- **Key Insight:** These are *not* smooth transitions—they involve crisis, institutional death, and paradigm conflict. The graph's smooth curves are deceptive.

## 3. Deployment Protocol

**Pre-requisites:**
- Leadership consensus that *some* disruption is coming (skeptics will sabotage the process)
- Cross-generational team: H1 operators (realism) + H2 entrepreneurs (urgency) + H3 visionaries (imagination)
- 2-3 month analysis cycle
- Willingness to confront organizational mortality (H1 will die—when?)

**Execution Sequence:**

**Phase I: Horizon Mapping (Weeks 1-4)**
- **Step 1:** Inventory current portfolio—classify every major initiative as H1/H2/H3
- **Step 2:** Plot on temporal graph (X-axis: time, Y-axis: strategic importance/resource allocation)
- **Step 3:** Identify "white spaces"—are we missing critical H2 bets? Over-invested in dying H1?
- **Space-Specific Question:** "If LEO becomes congested/militarized, what's our H2 pivot to cislunar operations?"

**Phase II: Inflection Analysis (Weeks 5-8)**
- **Step 1:** For each H1 domain, identify *specific* indicators of paradigm exhaustion
  - Example: GEO comms—declining spectrum availability, launch cost floor, NewSpace underselling
- **Step 2:** For each H2 initiative, define *graduation criteria* (what would prove it's ready for H1 scale?)
  - Example: Orbital refueling—demonstrate 95%+ transfer efficiency in operational environment
- **Step 3:** For each H3 vision, map *prerequisite capabilities*—what H2 successes must occur first?
  - Example: Lunar mining requires H2 achievements in: autonomous robotics, ISRU chemistry, cislunar logistics

**Phase III: Portfolio Rebalancing (Weeks 9-12)**
- **Scenario Testing:** "What if H1 collapses 5 years earlier than expected?" (Are H2 bets mature enough?)
- **Investment Reallocation:**
  - H1: Shift from growth to extraction (maximize cash, minimize new capex)
  - H2: Increase from 10% to 20-30% of budget (the critical transition window)
  - H3: Maintain at 3-5% but *actively curate*—kill zombie projects, double down on promising ones
- **Organizational Restructuring:** Create "Horizon 2 Tiger Teams" with protected budgets and C-suite sponsorship (insulated from H1 politics)

**Phase IV: Monitoring & Iteration (Ongoing)**
- Quarterly review: Has anything moved between horizons?
- Annual remap: Full portfolio reassessment
- **Critical Discipline:** Forcing function—at least one H3 vision must "graduate" to H2 status annually, or explain why not

**Output Format:** 
- Three Horizons visual portfolio map
- Horizon-by-horizon strategic narratives (explaining transition dynamics)
- Resource reallocation recommendations
- KPI dashboard (horizon-specific metrics)

## 4. Failure Modes & Constraints

**Cognitive Biases:**
- **Horizon 1 Gravity:** Organizations chronically under-invest in H2/H3 because H1 generates measurable results *today*. Quarterly earnings pressure exacerbates this. **Remedy:** Mandate H2/H3 protected budget floors (cannot be raided to cover H1 shortfalls).
- **Horizon 3 Fantasy:** Treating H3 as speculative fiction ("Mars colonies!") rather than disciplined strategic exploration. H3 becomes a corporate Disneyland. **Remedy:** Every H3 vision must identify *falsifiable* intermediate milestones. If milestones fail, kill the vision.
- **Horizon 2 Premature Scaling:** Mistaking early traction for paradigm shift (e.g., declaring "space tourism is H1" after 20 wealthy passengers). **Remedy:** Strict graduation criteria—H2 doesn't become H1 until it achieves 10x cost reduction or 100x scale increase.

**Structural Pathologies:**
- **The Missing Middle:** Organizations invest in H1 (safe) and H3 (prestigious) while starving H2 (risky but essential). H2 is where transformation actually happens; underfunding it guarantees obsolescence.
- **Linear Fallacy:** Treating horizons as sequential stages (finish H1 → start H2 → then H3). Reality: All three coexist. The framework is about *portfolio balance*, not phased replacement.
- **Time Compression Illusion:** Space industry systematically underestimates H2→H1 timelines (GEO to LEO transition took 40 years, not 10). Impatience kills H2 investments prematurely.

**Invalidation Conditions:**
- **Radical Discontinuity:** Framework assumes *evolutionary* transition. True Black Swans (e.g., discovery of traversable wormholes) render the framework obsolete.
- **Regime Lock-In:** In heavily regulated or geopolitically frozen domains, H1 can persist artificially long despite being economically/technically obsolete. Framework predicts disruption that never arrives.
- **Resource Scarcity:** Framework assumes ability to fund all three horizons. For resource-constrained organizations (most space agencies), it becomes aspiration, not strategy.

**Misuse Pattern:** Using Three Horizons to *justify* inaction ("We're strategically managing the transition"). The framework should create urgency, not complacency.

## 5. Integration Points

**Upstream Feeder:**
- **Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs):** Map TRL progression onto horizons—TRL 1-4 (H3), TRL 5-7 (H2), TRL 8-9 (H1)
- **PESTLE Analysis (1.1):** Use PESTLE to identify external forces accelerating/decelerating horizon transitions

**Downstream Amplifier:**
- **Scenario Planning (5.1):** Each scenario may have different horizon transition speeds—"What if H1 collapses in Scenario A but persists in Scenario B?"
- **Portfolio Management:** Three Horizons provides strategic rationale for R&D budget allocation across risk profiles

**Synergistic Pairing:**
- **S-Curve Analysis:** Plot each horizon on technology S-curves—H1 on declining curve, H2 on inflection point, H3 at innovation origin
- **Real Options Valuation:** H3 investments are essentially "call options" on future paradigms; option pricing models quantify their strategic value

**Sequential Logic:**
Environmental Scan → Three Horizons Portfolio Mapping → Scenario Planning (testing horizon transitions under different futures) → Resource Allocation

## 6. Exemplar Case

**Context:** National space agency portfolio review (European context, 2022-2024).

**Initial Portfolio Distribution (2022):**
- **H1 (75% of budget):**
  - GEO meteorological satellites
  - LEO Earth observation (mature constellations)
  - ISS partnership contributions
  - Ariane 5/6 institutional launches
- **H2 (18% of budget):**
  - Copernicus Sentinel expansion
  - Lunar Gateway participation
  - Small launcher development (Vega-C)
- **H3 (7% of budget):**
  - Lunar surface systems (ESA "Moon Village" concept)
  - Space-based solar power studies
  - Advanced propulsion R&D (electric, nuclear)

**Strategic Diagnosis:**
- **H1 Vulnerability:** GEO meteorology facing competition from LEO constellations (higher revisit, lower latency); Ariane 6 economics uncompetitive vs. SpaceX Falcon 9
- **H2 Underinvestment:** Gateway is NASA-driven; agency lacks autonomous H2 flagship demonstrating strategic autonomy
- **H3 Incoherence:** No clear vision connecting H3 experiments to operational future

**Three Horizons Analysis:**

**Critical Inflection Point Identified:**
- H1 institutional launch services (Ariane) approaching obsolescence
- H2 alternative: European reusable launcher (absent from portfolio)
- **Gap:** No transition plan from H1 to H2 in launch—institutional lock-in preventing H2 investment

**Recommended Portfolio Shift (2024):**
- **H1 (60%, down from 75%):**
  - Managed decline of Ariane program (extend operations but freeze new capex)
  - Shift ISS budget to commercial LEO station partnerships (earlier H2 activation)
- **H2 (30%, up from 18%):**
  - Launch: Establish European Reusability Tiger Team (public-private, protected funding)
  - In-Space: Accelerate robotic lunar logistics (ISRU precursor missions)
  - NewSpace: Increase commercial procurement from European startups
- **H3 (10%, up from 7%):**
  - Consolidate around single H3 vision: "Cislunar Economy Enablement"
  - Kill: Space-based solar power (technologically distant, no clear H2 path)
  - Double: Autonomous systems for extreme environments (robotic Moon/Mars operations)

**Implementation Tensions (2024-2025):**
- **Political Resistance:** Member states with Ariane heritage industries blocked reusability investment (H1 constituency defending dying paradigm)
- **Partial Victory:** Reusability R&D funded but at sub-optimal level (€300M vs. recommended €800M)
- **Organizational Conflict:** Traditional procurement teams (H1-optimized) struggled to manage H2's agile contracting requirements

**Monitoring Results (2025):**
- **H1 Decline Accelerated:** Ariane 6 market share below projections (SpaceX + Chinese launchers captured European customers)
- **H2 Progress:** First European vertical landing test (Prometheus engine) successful—graduation to H2 viable by 2028
- **H3 Validation:** NASA Artemis delays created opportunity window for European autonomous lunar systems—H3 vision proving strategically prescient

**Red Team Critique:**
- Framework didn't adequately address geopolitical constraints—European H2 strategy assumes continued access to global launch market, vulnerable to U.S./China competition
- Time horizons may be too optimistic: H2→H1 transition for reusability assumed 5-7 years; more realistic 10-15 years given European institutional pace
- Missing element: How to manage H1 *political* constituencies (jobs, regional development) during managed decline—purely technical framework insufficient

> **Practitioner Warning:** Three Horizons is a *portfolio framework*, not a technology roadmap. Its value is in forcing explicit recognition that the present is temporary and the future is emerging *now*. Organizations that use it purely as visualization exercise without rebalancing resources are engaging in strategic theater. The test of Three Horizons is not whether you draw the graph—it's whether H2 funding actually increases at H1's expense.
